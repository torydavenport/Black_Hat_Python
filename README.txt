These scripts are pulled from the book Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters
All credit for these scripts goto Justin Seitz, the author of the book and creator of these scripts. 

I have decided to upgrade these scripts to Python 3, with the collaberation of you all!

Let me know if you want to collaberate, I have very little accomplished and below is the following itenerary:

1. I need to type all the scripts up as they are from the book and test them with Python2 to weed out
   any errors.
2. I will then begin to upgrade them as I go to be compatable with Python 3!

I have upgraded the following so far:

  1. TCP_CLIENT.py SUCESSS
  2. UDP_CLIENT.py SUCCESS
  3. TCP_SERVER.py IN PROGRESS
     For this script I am getting a runtime error that I have not troubleshot yet. This script will run, 
     but then throws an error when it receives an inbound connection.
